# OpenAI-GPT-Powered-Behavioral-Biometrics
Behavioral biometrics is a cutting-edge field that focuses on analyzing user behavior to enhance security and authentication processes. This repository serves as a hub for everything related to this innovative technology.

# Keystroke Biometrics Authentication

This is a Python script for collecting keystroke dynamics, extracting features, and training a machine-learning model for user authentication based on keystroke behavior. It demonstrates a simplified version of behavioral biometrics.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Captures keystroke events and their timestamps for a specified duration (default 10 seconds).

- **Feature Extraction**: Computes key hold time, key release time, and typing speed from collected keystrokes.

- **Model Training**: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to train on keystroke features and user labels.

- **Authentication**: Authenticates a user based on their keystroke features using the trained model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `keyboard`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

Install the necessary libraries using `pip install keyboard numpy scikit-learn`.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python Behavioral_Biometrics.py`.

2. Follow the prompts and type to capture keystroke data.

3. The script simulates two users (user1 and user2) with random labels for demonstration. Replace this simulated data with actual user data for real authentication.

4. The machine learning model is trained on the simulated data.

5. Replace the simulated user keystroke features with actual user data for authentication. The predicted user label is printed.

## Notes

- This code is a simplified demonstration and should be extended for real-world use with actual user data.

- Modify the simulated user data and labels for authenticating real users.

- Ensure the user data is consistent with the feature extraction process.
